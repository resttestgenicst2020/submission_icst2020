# RestTestGen

A new version of the tool, including its source code, is available at this repository: [https://github.com/SeUniVr/RestTestGen](https://github.com/SeUniVr/RestTestGen).

# ICST Submission - RestTestGen

This is the companion repo for the paper **RESTTESTGEN: Automated Black-Box Testing of RESTful APIs** submitted to ICST 2020.

This repository is divided in two folders:
- `Tool components`: contains the tools described in the paper (as JAR files)
- `Case studies`: contains inputs and outputs of all the experiments.


Source-code is only partially available because the tool was developed during a collaborative project and we still have no permission by the project partners to share the source code.
